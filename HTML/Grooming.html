  <p>Grooming may not seem like a huge part of owning a dog but it is a big time commitment if done right.
    For bigger dogs who shed they will need to be brushed at least once a day if not more depending on how
    thick their coat is. To control the shedding you should do weekly or bi-weekly baths with a non-shed shampoo.
    Some people may not think you need to give your dog a haircut if it sheds but that's simply not true.
    Giving your dog a haircut will increase their appearance and decrease their shed.
    For smaller dogs who donâ€™t shed they will need daily brushing so their fur does not become matted but also
    frequent haircuts based on how fast their fur grows. Another big part of grooming for any dog is nail trimmings,
    this should be done every 3 to 4 weeks. Not trimming your dog's nails can lead to a number of health issues. </p>
