<p>Here is a list:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily camouflaged by brush and grass.</li>
    <li>Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.</li>
    <li>Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous if they bite a human.</li>
    <li>Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or while they are biting.</li>
    <li>It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale rattle warning, people can be bitten without knowing what has happened until they notice their symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.</li>
